Public RX14 Smells License 0.1 (RXSUX)

All wrongs reversed

You may fork RX14 or anyone else forking him if you so choose. There may
be only 7 (six) people forking RX14 at any given time, not including
bystanders. If the weight limit is exceeded, RX14 might poop his pants,
hence the name of this license. If you fork RX14 you must follow these
conditions forever and ever and ever and ever and so on. Basically you
now owe RX14 your soul.

FOR SOME REASON LICENSES OFTEN INCLUDE SOME TEXT SHOUTED AT THE READER.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DO THIS, SINCE IT IS REALLY RUDE. ANYONE USING
LICENSES THAT INCLUDE SHOUTY TEXTS ARE BASICALLY THE WORST EVER. THAT
INCLUDES RX14. WHAT AN ASS.
